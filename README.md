## 👋 Hi, I'm yyh

Full-stack developer focusing on **modern frontend engineering**, **Node.js ecosystems**, and **developer tooling**.
I enjoy building clean, scalable applications and exploring how to improve developer experience through better workflows and automation.

My current interests include:

* ⚛️ **Modern frontend** — React, Next.js, UI/UX patterns
* 🟦 **TypeScript & Node.js** — API design, tooling, CI/CD
* 🗂️ **Monorepo & engineering systems** — build pipelines, code quality, automation
* ⚙️ **Backend development with Python / FastAPI**
* 🔍 **Observability, debugging tools, and development workflows**
* 📦 **Open-source ecosystems** and modern dev tools

I like designing systems that feel elegant to use and maintain — both for myself and the teams that build on them.
