## 👋 Hi, I'm yyh

I'm a **Node.js full-stack engineer** focusing on **modern web applications**, **React / TypeScript**, and building **scalable, maintainable engineering systems**.

I care not only about shipping features, but about how systems evolve over time — improving **developer experience**, **code quality**, and **team workflows** through thoughtful architecture and tooling.

### Current Focus

* ⚛️ **Modern Web & Frontend Engineering**

  * React, Next.js
  * Component design, state management, UI/UX engineering patterns

* 🟦 **Node.js & TypeScript Full-Stack**

  * API design, BFF and full-stack architectures
  * Tooling, CI/CD, and developer productivity

* 🗂️ **Engineering Systems & Monorepos**

  * Build pipelines, testing strategies, code quality automation
  * Scalable project structures and team collaboration workflows

* 🤖 **Open Source & AI Applications**

  * LLM-powered applications and developer tools
  * Turning AI capabilities into real, usable products

* ⚙️ **Python**

  * FastAPI and backend services
  * Tooling and system-level development

I enjoy designing systems that are **pleasant to use and easy to maintain** — for myself and for the developers who build on top of them.
